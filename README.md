## Overview
This project is a simulation of a social media platform using Neo4j, a graph database. It focuses on modeling a simplified version of social media interactions, particularly interactions with posts.

## Features
- **Post Interaction**: Users can interact with posts by liking, commenting, or sharing them.
- **User Management**: Basic user management functionalities such as user registration and profile updates.
- **Post Management**: Creating, editing, and deleting posts by users.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of user interactions with posts using Neo4j's visualization tools.

## Installation
1. **Set up Neo4j**: Install Neo4j on your local machine or server.
2. **Database Schema**: Design and implement the database schema to represent users, posts, and interactions between them.
3. **Application Logic**: Develop the application logic using your preferred programming language (e.g., Java, Python) to interact with the Neo4j database and simulate post interactions.
4. **Run the Application**: Start the application and create schema with "Criar_n_s_para_os_perfis.cypher".
5. **Run the Querys**: Query 1 and Query 2

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional social media features such as user profiles, friend connections, and personalized feeds.
- Implementation of more sophisticated interaction models, including sentiment analysis of comments and user engagement metrics.
- Integration with external APIs for importing and exporting social media data.
